# Assumptions: 
# It is assumed that the URG flag is not being used legitimately. All segments with URG set will be dropped. You can change this behavior by commenting out the line with URG URG and uncomment the following lines.
# There is only one interface on the host, not counting the loopback.

# Notes:
# PREROUTING Chain: Tests immediately after being received by an interface and is much faster.
# PREROUTING is used with the raw, mangle and nat tables
#
# INPUT Chain: Tests right before being handed to a local process.
# INPUT OUTPUT are used with the default filter table.
#
# UDP as a client is handled with the RELATED clause at the end
#
# The order of rules is important, they are executed from top to bottom. The rules to check for 
# bad or illegal packets need to be before allowing services.
# Also, lines need to be ordered to minimize the traversal. For example, dhcp is used only on boot up or to update the lease. Therefore, it is at the end so the services do not have to pass through the rules.
# 

# Change the INPUT policy to ACCEPT, or you can lock yourself out. This needs to be the first rule, we will change it at the end to DENY
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
# Flush all current rules from iptables.

# Allow access for local host on the loopback. This might be overkill, but it is safer.  
# Locally created packets do not pass via the PREROUTING chain, so we need to use the INPUT and OUTPUT chains
